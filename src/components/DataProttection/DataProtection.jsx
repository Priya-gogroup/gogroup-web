Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", i.e. text files which are stored on your computer and which enable an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Due to the activation of IP anonymization on this website, however, your IP address will be shortened beforehand by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.

Data that has reached the end of its retention period is automatically deleted once a month.<br/><br/>

                            Our website uses Google Conversion Tracking. The operator of the Google AdWords services is Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. If you came to our website via an ad placed by Google, Google Adwords will place a cookie on your computer. The conversion tracking cookie is set when a user clicks on an ad served by Google.<br/><br/>

                            If the user visits certain pages of our website and the cookie has not yet expired, we and Google can recognize that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to this page. Each Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. This means that cookies cannot be tracked via the websites of AdWords customers. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers find out the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information with which users can be personally identified.<br/><br/>

                            You can find more information about data processing by Google in the Google data protection information: https://policies.google.com/privacy. There you can also change your personal data protection settings in the data protection center.<br/><br/>
